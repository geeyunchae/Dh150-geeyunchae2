## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction
Delish.com is a cooking recipe website that introduce variety of features for the users. All the recipes are introduced in video instruction along with approximate time length for all the dishes. The website provides seasonal recipes and information about the current food trend to the users. The user is able to search for specific recipe that they seek or get inspiration for their meal.

After examinating a heuristic analysis, usability problems were clearly visible.

First, the website does not follow the standard of placing a shopping cart button on the upper-right corner. If a user decides to shop for an item from the website, it will lead them unto another website to finish their purchase.
Second, the overall website is mixed of information, articles, and recipes. It creates confusion to the user.
Third, it fails to keep an aesthetic and minimalistic desing. The website has too much options in the naviagtion bar with complicated definitions for each of the item. 
Fourth, The text size on the homepage is not aligned. It is essential to organize the captions with size and alignments. 
Fifth, there is no "not found" or "error" function in the search results. This would make the users think that the search results are inaccurate, but also will not be helpful to correct the errors they've made. This website fails to precisely indicate the error or problem.

Therefore to test the effectivenes, I will conduct a usability test. It will carefully measure the user's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the website. The test will begin with informed consent. For task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for "Chocolate Cake" and see how accurate the search results are. It will also allow the user to provide feedbacks for what needs to be enhanced and their satisfaction of the search results. For task 2, I will ask the user to look for "halloween recipes" to test the website efficiency of user's search. It will help me to analyze how the easy the website is usable. Then, I will ask the user to look for the "shopping" options on the website. It will test the flow of how easy it leads the user to make purchase. From these questions, I will be able to see how easy or difficult it is to navigate through the website. It will lead on to further examination of enhancing the usability for the users.

### Methodology
For the Usability Test, I wil conduct the test in my room at my house. 
I will use my personal Macbook Pro by using Camtasia 2020 for recording the process. 

The usability test will be a pilot test. The process will start off with informed consent, pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, post-test questionnaire and followed by confidential demographic data. By the process, the user will be able to get a sense of the website and provide their feedbacks on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of their experience of the website.
