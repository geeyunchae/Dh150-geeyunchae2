# DH 150 Assignment 2- Gee Yun Chae

# Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction

Delish.com is a cooking recipe website that introduce variety of features for the users. All the recipes are introduced in video instruction along with approximate time length for all the dishes. The website provides seasonal recipes and information about the current food trend to the users. The user is able to search for specific recipe that they seek or get inspiration for their meal.

After examinating a heuristic analysis, usability problems were clearly visible.

First, the website does not follow the standard of placing a shopping cart button on the upper-right corner. If a user decides to shop for an item from the website, it will lead them unto another website to finish their purchase.
Second, the overall website is mixed of information, articles, and recipes. It creates confusion to the user.
Third, it fails to keep an aesthetic and minimalistic desing. The website has too much options in the naviagtion bar with complicated definitions for each of the item. 
Fourth, The text size on the homepage is not aligned. It is essential to organize the captions with size and alignments. 
Fifth, there is no "not found" or "error" function in the search results. This would make the users think that the search results are inaccurate, but also will not be helpful to correct the errors they've made. This website fails to precisely indicate the error or problem.

Therefore to test the effectivenes, I will conduct a usability test. It will carefully measure the user's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the website. The test will begin with informed consent. For task 1, I will ask the user to perform a search for "Chocolate Cake" and see how accurate the search results are. It will also allow the user to provide feedbacks for what needs to be enhanced and their satisfaction of the search results. For task 2, I will ask the user to look for "halloween recipes" to test the website efficiency of user's search. It will help me to analyze how the easy the website is usable. Then, I will ask the user to look for the "shopping" options on the website. It will test the flow of how easy it leads the user to make purchase. From these questions, I will be able to see how easy or difficult it is to navigate through the website. It will lead on to further examination of enhancing the usability for the users.


## Methodology

For the Usability Test, I wil conduct the test in my room at my house. 
I will use my personal Macbook Pro by using Camtasia 2020 for recording the process. 

The usability test will be a pilot test. The process will start off with informed consent, pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, post-test questionnaire and followed by confidential demographic data. By the process, the user will be able to get a sense of the website and provide their feedbacks on effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of their experience of the website.

## Reflection

During the usability test, all the process went very well. However, throughout the process I was able to find minor errors and typos in the survey. I also thought that some wordings or explanation might have not been very clear to the user. At the end of the test, I struggled a little to end the recording because of connection issues. For further tesings, I would have to ensure all these mistakes for better and accurate results. As a moderator, I realized that I have to be more careful and coincise with all the information and direction that I provide the user to ensure a pleasant experience. 

I was surprised that the user was actually able to find functions in the short period of time than I have expected. However, it was clear that the user was not very pleased with the overall design of the website. When asked to do a task, the user would have to naviagate and study the website throughly. The design was far off from the standard consistency of a general website which confused the user and even made her think that the website was overwhelming. The first two tasks were completed, but the last task was left incomplete. She was not able to find the shopping function from the website. It makes clear that this function in not effective or efficient. People often will not be able to recognize the function. I was able to learn and reassure the poor design and that it is in an urgent need for improvement. Delish.com can be a helpful resource where people can learn and inspired cook ingredients from the website. However, it needs organization in the format. Naviagation bar needs to be narrowed down with relevant and helpful items rather than just list any items that the website features. Also, there has to be categorical division in materials such as article, recipes, information, videos, and events. She also stated that people that are not very familiar with technology would not be able to utilize the website easily. This user's feedback indicates that the website needs improvements.
